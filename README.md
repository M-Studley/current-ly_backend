- **Real-Time Updates:** Users receive notifications when outage statuses change.
- **Historical Data:** Analyze historical outage data to track reliability by area.
- **Location-Based Outage Information:** Provides outage details using a map interface to enhance user accessibility.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
- **Data Storage & Caching:** Firebase for notifications, Redis for caching
- **Geospatial Data:** GeoAlchemy2 to handle location-based data and mapping
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure user access
- **Containerization:** Docker for PostgreSQL and potentially the full app stack
